## Usage

### Clone this repository

Type the following commands in your terminal:
```bash
cd path/to/directory/
git clone https://github.com/Aman-py/Self_Driving_Car
cd Self_Driving_Car/

### Run the pretrained model

Start up the [Udacity self-driving simulator](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim), choose a scene and press the Autonomous Mode button.  Then, run the model as follows:

```python
python Drive.py
```
